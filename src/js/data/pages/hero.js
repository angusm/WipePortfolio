                    keeps me pretty happy. I love writing code, but that doesn't
                    make me particularly unique amongst developers. I think what
                    sets me apart is that I don't just love greenfield projects.
                    It's a little weird, but I think I may enjoy working in
                    existing code just as much if not more. Refactoring out
                    redundancies, scrapping unnecessary code, upping test
                    coverage and plain old bug-fixes are immensely satisfying.`,
                    `When I'm not working on code, if I'm being honest, I'm not
                    crazy exciting. I'm probably playing videogames with my
                    brothers, binging on Netflix with my fianc√©e or prepping
                    to DM the next DND session with my friends. Although
                    occasionally I get out of the house to visit family, check
                    out a new brewery or dirtbike for a bit.`
